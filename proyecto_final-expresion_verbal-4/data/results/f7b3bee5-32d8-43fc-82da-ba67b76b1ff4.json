        "summary": "I'm so excited to be in Taiwan. I've always wanted to come to Taiwan and I would actually like to meet every single person here. So in case I don't get the time, I wanted to put my email address up here so that everybody could hear, could email me and say hello. The only thing is, well, who is your one? Learn to ignore logic and trust emotion. Ange our entire life. They are what our life is, are our choices. So if life is choice, how do you make good choices? People make better choices when they trust their gut feeling on something. Learn to seek what is only good enough. A $5 calculator is still better than this at math. Every choice you have to make in life causes a little bit of pain. We find that we are happier when we let other people make some choices for us. People like having rules being told what to do. Life is defined by the time between when you're born and when you die. So the meaning of life is time. How can you use time wisely? First is to remember that it's limited. It's important to be mostly future focused. People who do this are usually more successful in life and even happier. But it often comes at the expense of things that require a present focus, such as family and relationships. It's important to only be somewhat present focused and it's also important to be somewhat past focused, meaning to remember your past is to live twice. People at the end of their life that were the happiest are the ones that have spent the most time in the state of flow, in the zone. Life has to be about memory because if you don't remember your life, it's like it never happened. So that's how to use time wisely. What do you think? Pretty good argument that the meaning of life is time? Life is all about how we communicate with each other. A life spent in solitude, never communicating, is not a life actually lived. That's important to always choose the changing option, to not get stuck into routines. CNN's John Sutter has lived in Korea, Japan and China for years. He says he's learned that the word quality has different meanings in each country. Sutter: \"Even if we all learn English as this common language, there's still this cultural translation\" TED Talk: What if life is learning? We're all here at TED, we love to learn. How can you best learn? You have to learn the difference between the idea of the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. The Buddha says life is suffering, I'm not even gonna talk about that. What if you say that life is love? Okay, so let's take a break from it. So, a few years ago, I s Tarted learning some Chinese. \"What I loved the most about it is that I'm trying to memorize how to write these characters\" The Talking Heads wrote their lyrics by cutting up pieces of paper and throwing them into a bowl. They would put them in the order that they pulled them out, and then put them into the bowl. The songwriter says he tried to find the meaning of the characters in the song. He found that the characters had been replaced with just phonetic sound delikes. Life is just life. It has no inherent meaning at all. You just project whatever meaning suits you. The most important thing, and really the punch line of this whole talk, is to remember to remove whatever meaning is holding you back. I think that humans are also 99% un-used potential. And most of us, the thing holding you back from where you are to where you want to be is always in your head. So if you learn that life has no meaning, you can do whatever you want. Thank you.",

        "full_transcription": " Okay. I'm so excited to be in Taiwan. I've always wanted to come to Taiwan and I would actually like to meet every single person here. So in case I don't get the time, I wanted to put my email address up here so that everybody could hear, could email me and say hello. The only thing is, well, who is your one? So please email me in French. Okay. And next, I need the audience to do something for me. I need everybody to sing a long, low note. Go. Everybody go. A little louder. Okay. Thank you. So to do a great talk in Taiwan, to live up to my excitement to be here, I'm going to talk about the meaning of life. Are you ready to learn the meaning of life? I know the answer. Are you ready? Yeah. Okay. What word do you think goes there? Life is what? Any ideas? Shout something. Anybody? Okay. Okay. I'm going to propose a few ideas. Let's say that life is choice. Life is all about choice. We make 100 little choices every day. We make 100 big choices in our life. And these little choices and the big choices we make change our entire life. They are what our life is, are our choices. So if life is choice, how do you make good choices? Well, here's some ideas. First, learn to ignore logic and trust emotion. And what this means is, you know, we have different parts of our brain, right? So at the base of our brain, at the top of our spine, is the ancient brain that we share in common with lizards and rabbits. And it's called the amygdala. So this emotional brain just stores instincts, fears, and you call gut feelings, right? So at the front of our brain, we have the prefrontal cortex that is a relatively new development that handles logic and language and predictions, right? So what's interesting is that everything we learn gets processed through here and its process, but then it's permanently stored here as emotions. So we often like to think of ourselves as smart, rational beings and whenever we have to make an important choice, we try to think it through very rationally. But the truth is, is that this thing in the front is pretty new, which is why a $5 calculator is still better than this at math. So the way that you make better choices in life is to understand this about your brain and understand that this gut feeling is the culmination of everything you have ever learned in your life is stored as emotional gut reactions. And it's been proven that people make better choices when they trust their gut feeling on something that is usually more correct than when they try to overthink it and use their $5 calculator brain. So next, how to make good choices? Learn to seek what is only good enough. And what this means is, in this modern world, we have more choices than ever. But if you try, because of all of these choices, you try to make the best possible choice. And you drive yourself crazy trying to find the best option to do the best thing with your life to choose the best career, the best school, the best partner, then you're going to make yourself miserable. Whereas if you learn to understand this feeling of saying, this is good enough and I'm happy with this, you actually make better choices and you feel better about it. Next, learn to embrace limits. What this means is that every choice you have to make in life causes a little bit of pain. It's a little tough when you have to make a choice. So while it's true that we all need some choice in life, this doesn't mean that more choice is better. So we find that we are actually happier when we let other people make some choices for us. This is why when you go to the doctor, say if you were very sick, you go to the doctor, you don't want the doctor to say, I don't know, what do you want to do? You say, no, you tell me what to do. And this is also part of the appeal of religion. That religion says, follow these rules. And it's been proven over history that people like having rules being told what to do. It relieves some of that for us. So lastly, learn to choose what's important, not urgent. What this means is that what is urgent are the SMS messages, the phone calls, the texts and the emails. These things are urgent, but what is important is perhaps spending 1,000 hours learning a new skill that will really help you in your career or your life. Or what's important is giving your full attention to your child or your partner or even a potential new business relationship. And what is important is taking time to get outside and slowly eat a meal of real food. But none of these things will ever be urgent, but these are important. And that's how to make better choices. So let's say that life is choice. What do you think? Pretty good argument? OK. Everybody, I need you to sing the note again. OK. Next idea, what if life is time? We could say life is all about time. That the meaning of life is time because life is defined by the time between when you're born and when you die. That's what we call life. So the meaning of life is time. If true, how can you use time wisely? First is t",
